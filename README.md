# CineMate

This is for the project of R Module with Professor Nicolussi.
The app is deployed here https://ashkansam.shinyapps.io/CineMate/

Dear Professor Nicolussi
My name is Ashkan Samavatian with matriculation number 965235 and this is my shiny app project.
CineMate is composed by cinema and mate (It means cinema's friend).
In this app I use some datasets about movies from http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/.
Actually the datasets contain the information about up to 1 million movies all around the world.
In the first tab (home page) there is a welcome note for users.
In the second tab (search movies) users will be able to search by titles, geners, years, people, etc and gain some information about the movies.
In the third tab (Movies by Year) there is a plot related to the data. 
Sincerely
Ashkan Samavatian
